# secintro-samples
Code samples for the course Introduction to Information Security 

This repository contains Python and Golang sample code for the course. 
The code samples are intended to work as a skeleton for you own code. It can be daunting to start from scratch, particularly without much programming experience. 

The Go samples can be run in the Go playground at https://play.golang.org or compiled to a binary on a host that has Golang installed. You can get the Golang compiler from: https://golang.org/. Also the linux-ssh.cc.tut.fi SSH-machine has Golang installed. You should apply for an account through https://www.tut.fi/omatunnus (not a phishing link, trust me) 

Building and Running code with Go 
---------------------------------
go build ex-1-4.go
./ex-1-4 

Because some of the students are more familiar with Python (or otherwise brain damaged) some Python examples are provided as well. If the exercise depends heavily on some library, or the dude making the exercise work has found good copypaste sources only in the other language, either python sample or Golang sample could be omitted.
